Basics:
	A game starring the characters from MW:ADC. Kind of a cross between an RPG and an adventure game.
	Also developing a core system that can be reused in other games.



TODO:
	DoneThisCommit:
		Converted to 3D
	Current Task:
	Next Steps:
		Implement "GameObject" class.
		Change loading to use XML instead of AngelScript.
		Implement Controller and ControlledObject classes, as well as a switch and flame jets for the demo level.


	Objects:
		Controllers and ControlledObjects--eg light switch and lamp, or switch and door.
			ControlledObject should use a FSM
		Some mechanism by which you can easily move between a set list of places (teleportation, taxicab, etc.). Long glides, jumps, etc. may leave you stranded otherwise.
	Scripting:
		Add ability to load (not run) an AngelScript file, adding functions, variabels, object types, etc to the current context/module.
			Can use the CompileFunction and CompileGlobalVar functions to add functions and variables.
	Should define stats with XML, not AngelScript.
	Animation
	AI:
		Enemies need more intelligent behavior (e.g. dodge)
	Physics:
		Should have two collision categories for obstacles: ground-level and body-level. Projectiles will be stopped by body-level obstacles (e.g. trees), but not ground-level (e.g. water).
	Stuff for first playable
	Input:
		Should be able to register a function to be executed on key press/release. Function will likely be in AngelScript.
	Use a game clock that's separate from the real-time clock. For debugging purposes. Allows to run the game in slow/fast motion.
	Development cheats and features:
		Teleportation
		Changing game speed
	Level2D should contain lighting, enemies, and other things that would be in the scene.
	Make sure it all works on Windows (with the exception of the extra mouse button support I added)

BUGS:
	input handler does not respond to releasing a key if Ctrl is pressed. Most likely due to the way OSG reports the button. I think it's a different value if a modkey is pressed.
	Seg faults upon closing.
		Note that unless the program exits normally, profiling won't work.
		Problem appears to be caused by osgText. If there are no text nodes, it works fine (if you use Alt+F4, not escape). For profiling purposes, remove the console and the debug displayer from the scene graph, and make sure no temporary text remains.
	Console does not appear until window is resized
	Weapons do not point in the correct direction (rotated relative to the owner)
	Character faces the wrong way at times
	2D Stuff:
		TiledMap does not account for maps with multiple tilesets.
		Seg faults if the Box2D debug drawer sets the data variance to "dynamic"

Things to remember to prevent bugs:
	It is NOT safe to alter the scene graph during a traversal (multi-threaded, multiple traversals happen at the same time). To ensure that doesn't happen, use the addToSceneGraph function for any new nodes, rather than adding them directly.


Useful notes:
	Entity systems:
		Rationalization for entities instead of traditional class-based system is that in most applications, the behavior of objects doesn't change, but in games, an object could change roles (e.g. an enemy is stunned and no longer attacks). An entity-component system allows behavior to be changed during runtime simply by adding and removing components.

Scripting Uses:
	Input-- so that options can be set more easily. In addition to the standard key bindings, it'll also be possible to define custom controls that depend on more than a single binding.
	AI?
	Weapons/attacks/enemies
	"You want to expose capable, but soulless actors to your scripting code. The scripting code describes what the actors should do, but the C++ code takes care of the how."	-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/609076/the-role-of-scripting-languages-in-game-programming

Expose to scripting:
	Camera control?--For cutscenes
	The basics: enemies, player, et cetera


Innovative combat system:
	Rather than simply hand the player a bunch of weapons, you're given tools to make your own. You get various weapon bodies that you add some kind of magic power source to, and it creates an elemental weapon. A lot of enemies have some sort of immunity, so you need to think about what attack you use. Often, attacks must be chained, e.g. freeze the enemy, then shatter them.
	Not sure how far to go with this. Could just have body + magic = weapon, or could provide a more flexible system that allows people to experiment and design new weapons, controlling not just element and weapon type, but properties like fire rate, power, etc. For example, you might be able to alter the component that interacts with the magic power source, and overclock it to get more power or faster firing. I think it could be a pretty awesome system.
	Power sources:
		Phoenix feather-- Fire. Also good for healing.


Multiple playable characters:
	I'll likely be working on this thing for a long time, so I'd like to be able to put all my main characters in it. Show off my best character-creation and dialog skills. And just enjoy it more.
	Each character is unique. They all have their own powers, and even different play experiences.
		Luce:
			After doing something really awful, everyone insists he gets a morality meter. Which he does. It ranges from blue to orange.
			Sees extended information on enemies.
			Has hallucinations.
			Can drive people insane by showing them The Truth.
			Entertaining dialog options.
		Alex:
			Breathes fire.
			Immune to fire.
			Healing.
		Tanner:
			Adorable.
			Can nap to recover energy.
			Kittenriffic.
	Probably a good idea. Even if it doesn't work for the final game, it will allow me to experiment with all the characters, and see who people like playing as.


Goals:
	First playable-- demo level with basic functionality.
		Functionality:
			Combat-- GOT IT!!
			Weapon system
			Basic enemy AI-- look for the player, and try to kill him.
			Scripting--DONE!! (or close enough)
			Physics
		Assets:
			Enemies-- at least two types, killed in different ways
			Weapons-- at least one body, at least two power sources.
			A few standin models.
			Basic level, with at least one puzzle
				Puzzle idea: hallway full of flame jets, Alex needs to go through and activate some switch to open a door for the others. Unfortunately, the switch also locked him inside the room, and the others need to find a switch to free him.


Stuff Learned:
	Tile maps:
		To avoid bad edges, set filtering to "Nearest", meaning that GL shouldn't try any antialiasing.
