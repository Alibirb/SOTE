Basics:
	A game starring the characters from MW:ADC. Kind of a cross between an RPG and an adventure game.
	Also developing a core system that can be reused in other games.


TODO:
	DoneThisCommit:
		Revised attack system:
			Added Attack class
		Made Entities use a StateMachine.
	Current Task:
		Revise attack system. Add Attack class.
	Next Steps:
		Improve import/export to allow it to link to prototypes.
		Make a class to wrap around the physics stuff
			Should also expose the physics info to the object files.
		Add mechanism for key bindings
		Ability to pause the game to switch between edit and play modes (even if edit mode does nothing)
		Flame jets for the demo level.
		Expose all GameObject-derived classes to AngelScript (also exposing the type hierarchy (see http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_adv_class_hierarchy.html))
	Minor Tasks:
		logError and logWarning should allow multiple parameters.
	Under consideration:
		Perhaps GameObjectData getter methods should use pass-by-reference so you can just pass in the variable you want to assign.


	Objects:
		Some mechanism by which you can easily move between a set list of places (teleportation, taxicab, etc.). Long glides, jumps, etc. may leave you stranded otherwise.
		Figure out how best to use AngelScript to specify object behavior (AngelScript class cannot inherit a C++ class, so it's not that simple.)
	Scripting:
		Add ability to load (not run) an AngelScript file, adding functions, variables, object types, etc to the current context/module.
			Can use the CompileFunction and CompileGlobalVar functions to add functions and variables.
	AI:
		Enemies need more intelligent behavior (e.g. dodge)
	Stuff for first playable
	Input:
		Should be able to register a function to be executed on key press/release. Function will likely be in AngelScript.
	Use a game clock that's separate from the real-time clock. For debugging purposes. Allows the game to run in slow/fast motion.
	Development cheats and features:
		Changing game speed
	Lighting should be done with Light objects, rather than lights freely floating in the scene graph.
	Physics fixes:
		figure out proper collision filtering technique for ghost objects (there should be no collision response, but it still needs to be detected.)
	Make sure it all works on Windows (with the exception of the extra mouse button support I added)
	Clean up:


BUGS:
	input handler does not respond to releasing a key if Ctrl is pressed. Most likely due to the way OSG reports the button. I think it's a different value if a modkey is pressed.
	The ghost object for the switch stops the player's movement.
	Console does not appear until window is resized
	Weapons do not point in the correct direction (rotated relative to the owner)
	Lighting needs work. Should figure out how to ensure every surface is lit.
	Collision checking (in Level) may call onCollision() multiple times for the same pair of objects if they have multiple manifolds, or if Bullet takes multiple simulation steps for one rendering step.
	Doors open, but do not close (not sure how to have multiple animations in Bullet, so currently they can have an open animation or a closing animation, but not both.)
	Low Priority (it works, but might be ugly):

Bugs I expect to see later:


Issues: (with other software)
	Not sure how to have multiple animations on an object in Blender. See http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Animation/Basics/Actions

Things to remember to prevent bugs:
	It is NOT safe to alter the scene graph during a traversal (multi-threaded, multiple traversals happen at the same time). To ensure that doesn't happen, use the addToSceneGraph function for any new nodes, rather than adding them directly.


Things to consider:
	Check out AngelScript/sdk/samples/game. Uses a "controller" class to control game objects. Might be a useful approach.


Useful notes:
	Entity systems:
		Rationalization for entities instead of traditional class-based system is that in most applications, the behavior of objects doesn't change, but in games, an object could change roles (e.g. an enemy is stunned and no longer attacks). An entity-component system allows behavior to be changed during runtime simply by adding and removing components.

Scripting Uses:
	Input?--so that options can be set more easily. In addition to the standard key bindings, it'll also be possible to define custom controls that depend on more than a single binding.
	AI
	Testing purposes.
	"You want to expose capable, but soulless actors to your scripting code. The scripting code describes what the actors should do, but the C++ code takes care of the how."	-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/609076/the-role-of-scripting-languages-in-game-programming
	Used to define the behavior of objects. C++ will only contain a handful of game object classes. AngelScript is responsible for determing the properties and behavior of each object.
	scene definition (movement, special effects, camera, sounds, etc.)


Engine features:
	Adaptive. Designed to minimize the amount of custom code that must be written.
	Objects are defined with YAML (or other serialization format).
		Can embed in the level file, link to an external file, or both (using external file as prototype and making necessary alterations in the level file).
			Can also define an object using another as a prototype (e.g. multiple versions of an enemy use a common base).
		Can embed AngelScript inside the YAML file, further increasing adaptability.
			Can attach functions to an object, to be used elsewhere (e.g. a door has the functions "open()" and "close()" defined in a central location, and called in response to signals from a switch.)
	Views a game as a collection of objects, behaviors, and relationships.



Goals:
	First playable-- demo level with basic functionality.
		Functionality:
			Combat-- GOT IT!!
			Basic enemy AI-- look for the player, and try to kill him.
			Scripting--DONE!! (or close enough)
			Physics
		Assets:
			Enemies-- at least two types.
			A few standin models.
			Basic level, with at least one puzzle
				Puzzle idea: hallway full of flame jets, Alex needs to go through and activate some switch to open a door for the others. Unfortunately, the switch also locked him inside the room, and the others need to find a switch to free him.
