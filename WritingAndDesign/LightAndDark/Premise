When you live in the light, you're blind to the dark.

The Age of Light is upon us. All the horrors of the darkness are being pushed out. Killed, or simply left to die in the light of artificial suns.

To most, it is an age of greatness. Of safety and peace. But to us... it is the end.

The darkness is a cruel environment. Predators lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce. To eat you. But despite--or perhaps because of--this danger, the darkness holds a great beauty. It's full of mystery and wonder. Yes, there are monsters, but if you look hard enough, you'll see a world of endless possibilities. A world that has evolved for life in the dark.

The humans fear us. They claim the darkness has corrupted us. What they call corruption, we call adaptation. While they try to change the world to fit them, we changed ourselves to fit the world.

They blind the world with their light. They disturb the natural order. And I'm going to make things right. Whatever it takes.

Plot:
	You choose one of two main characters to follow:
		A Lightbringer
		A Malhela
	In both cases, your initial goal is to reclaim territory lost to the other side (destroying the Light Crystals or eliminating the Dark Fog)
	The two characters likely run into each other a few times and fight.
	Eventually, they both get captured by humans, and locked up together. They talk, and realize that they're both just trying to save their own species and reclaim the territory that belongs to them. They escape together, and join forces to try to find a way for both sides to live in peace.
	Later, they discover that both the Light Crystals and the Dark Fog are living creatures using the Malhela and the Lightbringers as hosts to spread the infection. Occasionally, the infection will overtake the body, and the person turns into a mere factory to create more Fog/Crystals.
