If you are reading this note, my body is dead.
But I survive.
I hope.
I have a device--a SpiritSaver--designed to sustain the mind and spirit after the body has been destroyed. I now live on inside it. Trapped. Waiting to be transplanted to a new body.
I ask that you provide me with a suitable replacement body. If you comply, I promise to share my knowledge with your planet. I will teach you how all the technology on this ship works.
The SpiritSaver is a highly versatile system. Once implanted, it will alter the body to suit my needs. To make these alterations easier, it is essential the body be in a stage of growth. A body that has yet to assume its final shape.
It is also essential that the body be already capable of supporting an intelligent lifeform. For this reason, I request one of the same species you use for your own bodies.
A human (or furry) child.

[Cut to Zack being chased. It appears that you're being chased so your body can be used for the alien. In reality, the transfer is already complete, and you're being chased to reclaim the SpiritSaver. Big plot twist when you discover that.]
