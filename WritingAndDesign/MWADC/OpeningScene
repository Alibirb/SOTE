Lilly: Father! <runs to Father John's side>
Father John: Lilly. Thank God you're here. I... I'm dying. I need you to--
Lilly: No. You're not going to die. Alex is here. He can heal you, and--
Alex: I'm sorry. I--he's been poisoned. I can heal the damage it's done to his system, but... I can't get rid of the poison. All I can do is hold it back for a while.
Lilly: Then--then do it. We can get him to a hospital, and--
Father John: No. Save your strength. There's no antidote. Just... just keep me alive long enough to... to give you my message.
Alex: Okay. [Starts healing him]
Father John: Thank you. [Turns to Lilly] They're looking for something. Holy artifacts. I need you to recover them before they do.
Lilly: [Crying] No. There has to be a way to save you, I--
Father John: I wish there was. But... I have done my part, and now, you must do the rest. Listen closely. They're gathering a set of holy artifacts. I don't know what they are. Or what they do. But you cannot allow those... those monsters... to complete the set. Whatever they have planned, you <em>must</em> stop them. [Looks straight at Lilly] Promise me, you will stop them.
Lilly: [Nods] I--I won't let them get away with it. I swear.
Father John: I knew I could count on you. Thank you. Now, it is time for me to leave you.
[silence]
Father John: [Turns to Alex] That... was your cue to let the poison take its toll.
Alex: No. You don't get to die until Lilly's said goodbye.
Lilly: Father, I--I'm sorry. You've done so much for us. We--we just watched. Watched them--that knife--it came from the case they stole. Was that--
Father John: No. It was... powerful. Enchanted. But it was a toy compared to whatever else was in there.
Lilly: We should have stopped them. We should have acted before--as soon as we--
Father John: [Smiles] Do not blame yourself, my child. This is all part of the Lord's plan. I don not understand it, but... He works in mysterious ways.
[Camera pans upwards. Title rolls  in: Mysterious Ways: [insert rest of the game's title here]]

Lilly: When we find the men that did this...
Alex: Yeah?
Lilly: Burn them alive.
Alex: You know just what to say to a pyromaniac dragon.
Lilly: Make them beg for Hell.
Alex: You've gotten really dark, you know that? Also, can I eat them? Please?
Lilly: Go ahead.
Alex: Score.
