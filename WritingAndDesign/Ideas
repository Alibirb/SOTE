Idea:
	Collect-a-thon platformer, have to complete challenges to get some magical items to save the world.
		Found scattered about, or in the hands of random people
		Example:
			"What the hell is this thing?"
			"Hey, can we have that? We need to collect all of them to save the world."
			"To save the world? Sure, I got no use for it."
			"Score"
		Later:
			"What the hell is this thing?"
			"Hey, can we have that? We need to collect all of them to save the world."
			"To save the world? You need ALL of them?"
			"Yeah."
			"So... you'd be willing to do just about ANYTHING to get this one, then?"
			"Uh... I... guess."
			"Okay. Suck. My. Di--" *Something horrible happens to him* "T--take it. Just... take it."
	Could take place in the Otherworld, to allow for crazy levels (which are a staple of the old platforming games like Spyro)
	Levels in both the physical world and the Otherworld
		The Otherworld levels should all be really crazy and fun (like Dreamweavers, The MilkMan Conspiracy, Cloud Cuckoo Land, et cetera)
